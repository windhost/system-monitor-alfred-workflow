### 1. Top Processes

#### A. Keywords:

##### 1.) `top`: Show a mixed processes list based on top cpu/memory usage.


###### 1. `top -m`, `top --memory` to show processes ranked by memory usage

###### 2. `top -c`, `top --cpu`, to show processes ranked by cpu usage

###### 3. `top -i`, `top --io`, to show processes ranked by io usage with **callback** from top io trace collector.

   Top IO requires [DTrace][Dtrace] and it would take a while to finish. The new **callback** design is to run the job in he background and post a notification (OSX 10.8+) using notification center. Click on the notification to show the result in alfred.
